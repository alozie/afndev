# Update Dev Script

This small script assumes that we are on a server with `acquia` defined as the Acquia server remote and `upstream` defined as the main repository. This also assumes that we are using a `develop` branch used by git-flow. If these are not used, the script can be edited.

## Usage
`bash update-dev.sh`

This will update the code without creating any local branches.
