## Quick Overview
Custom components in Drupal can be created by defining how they are themed in the `hook_theme()` function. We recommend the use of templates for consistency. In this method, the template is passed a render array and each portion of the custom component is then rendered inside the template.

In this example, we are using a ctools pane plugin to build create our component and the `hook_theme()` and template to display the content. This can be done with other types of components as well.
