# Onboarding

Here is a quick-start guide to getting your local development environment
set up and getting oriented with the project standards and workflows.

## Required SAAS Access:

Please ask the project's engagement manager for access to the following SAAS
services:

* JIRA
* GitHub repository
* Acquia Cloud subscription

## System Requirements

You should be able to use the following tools on the command line of your native
operating system:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
* PHP 5.3.9+ (PHP 5.6 recommended). PHP installation instructions:
    * [OSX](http://justinhileman.info/article/reinstalling-php-on-mac-os-x/)
    * [Windows](http://php.net/manual/en/install.windows.php)
    * [Linux](http://php.net/manual/en/install.unix.debian.php)

### Operating Systems

We highly recommend that you *do not use Windows* directly for development.
Many development tools (e.g., drush, gulp, etc.) are not built or tested for
Windows compatibility. Furthermore, most CI solutions (e.g., Travis CI,
Drupal CI, etc.) do not permit testing on Windows OS. Similarly, Bolt cannot be
fully tested on Windows and is unsupported on this platform.

If you must use Windows, we recommend that:
* You have administrator access to your machine
* You execute the necessary command line functions a bash emulator such as:
    * [Git Bash](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)
    * [cmder](http://cmder.net/)
    * [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)
* Run Bolt inside of a Drupal-VM instance

### Networking considerations

Building project dependencies requires that your local machine make HTTP and
HTTPS requests to various software providers on the internet. Please ensure
that your local and network level security settings permit this to happen.

If you need to make requests via a proxy server, please [configure git to use
a proxy](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19213999). This will cover all git based
requests made by Composer.

## Initial Setup

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the primary GitHub
   repository
1. Clone your fork to your local machine:

       ```
       git clone git@github.com:username/project-repo.git -b develop
       git remote add upstream git@github.com:acquia-pso/project-repo.git
       ```

1. Checkout the `develop` branch. `git checkout develop`
1. Run `composer install` (you must already have Composer installed).
1. Run `./task.sh setup:drupal:settings` This will generate
  `docroot/sites/default/settings/local.settings.php` and
  `docroot/sites/default/local.drushrc.php`. Update these with your local
  database credentials and your local site URL.
1. Run `./task.sh setup`. This will build all project dependencies and install
   drupal.

After this initial setup, you should only need to run `./task.sh setup:build:all`
when composer.json is updated, and `./task.sh setup:drupal:install` when you
need to reinstall the site.

For a full list of available project tasks, run `./task.sh -l`. See
[Project Tasks](project-tasks.md) for more information.

### Local Git Configuration

For readability of commit history, set your name and email address properly:

    git config user.name "Your Name"
    git config user.email your-email-address@example.com

Ensure that your local email address correctly matches the email address for
your Jira account.

## GitHub Configuration

In order to more easily identify developers in a project, please be sure to set
a name and profile picture in your GitHub profile.

When working with GitHub, the [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) utility can
be helpful when managing forks and pull requests. Installing hub largely depends
on your local environment, so please follow the [installation instructions]
(https://github.com/github/hub#installation) accordingly.

## Configure Local Environment

Please see [Local Development](local-development.md) for detailed information
on setting up a local \*AMP stack.

When you have completed setting up your local \*AMP stack, please have the
following information ready and available:

* The intended local URL of the site
* The local database credentials

## Next steps

Review review the following documentation:

* [Repository architecture](repo-architecture.md): “how is the code organized, and why?”
* [Running project tasks](project-tasks.md): “how do I _____ on my local machine?”
* [Workflow](dev-workflow.md): “I wrote code, how does it get from here to there?”
* [Automated testing](/template/tests/README.md): “how do I write / run them, and why should care?”
