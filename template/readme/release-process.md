# Release Process

Each release should be accompanied by a set of release notes, which can be
easily generated using the [Release Notes Script]
(../scripts/release-notes/README.md)

Please see [deploy.md](deploy.md) for instructions on manual and automated generation
and deployment of a production-ready build artifact.

@todo add documentation for:
* Branching strategies
* Tagging
* Notifications (slack, hipchat, etc)
