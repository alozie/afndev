# What does this script do?
# This script will watch for a specific Travis $build_job on a specific
# $source_branch on the canonical GitHub repository and deploy build artifacts
# to $dest_branch on the git.remote specified in project.yml.

# How to use this script?
# This script should be executed in the `after_success` section of .travis.yml.
# It requires three arguments. Example call:
# `scripts/deploy/travis-deploy.sh build:validate:test master master-build`
