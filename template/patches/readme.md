# Patches

All project-specific patches (i.e., those not hosted on Drupal.org) should
reside in this directory. This ensures one consistent place for patches and
avoids accidental patch deletion.

Patches should be stored in sub-directories based on project name being patched.

Examples:

- /patches/drupal/some_patch-1234-1.patch
- /patches/ctools/another_patch_name-9876-12.patch
