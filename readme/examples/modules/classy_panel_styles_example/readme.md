# Classy Panel Styles

The Classy Panel Styles module allows you to add styles to panels through the UI. This then applies classes to the panels which you can use for styling.

The Classy Panel Style configuration cannot be stored in a theme and the MODULE_NAME.classy_panel_styles.inc file must be in the root of the module.

It is recommended to define your classy panel styles in the theme and point classy panel styles to that CSS file.
